Papaya can be compiled and installed in few steps. From your favourite
shell type:

./bootstrap.sh
./configure 
make 
make install

The default install prefix is /usr/local/ (thus the binary will be
installed in /usr/local/bin). 
You will need to supply a valid configuration file. Just copy
papaya.conf.xml shipped with the source, edit it and live with it.
